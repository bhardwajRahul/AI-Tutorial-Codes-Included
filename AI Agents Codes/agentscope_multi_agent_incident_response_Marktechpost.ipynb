            "5. **No Follow-Up Actions**: The next steps are vague and lack specific timelines or responsible parties for follow-up actions.\n",
            "6. **Formatting Issues**: The report could benefit from clearer headings and bullet points for better readability.\n",
            "7. **Lack of Visual Aids**: Consider including charts or graphs to illustrate the traffic spike and error rates.\n",
            "8. **No Lessons Learned Section**: The report does not include a section for lessons learned, which is crucial for future prevention.\n",
            "9. **No Mention of Customer Communication**: The report does not address how the company communicated with affected customers during the incident.\n",
